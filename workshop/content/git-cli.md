In this step you will install the git CLI.

Browse to [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to download and install git.

If you already have the git CLI installed, run the following command:

```sh
git --version
```

If git is not installed, you will be prompted to install Xcode Command Line Tools which takes a while to download and install.
