Welcome to the TAPathon!

The TAPathon is a hands-on training sponsored by Tanzu Labs. The intent is to prepare you with the knowledge you need to be a successful Tanzu Labs consultant with customers who have procured, or are thinking about procuring, TAP for their enterprise.

Right now you're using the [Learning Center](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.3/tap/GUID-learning-center-about.html) feature of TAP to prepare yourself for participation in the TAPathon.
