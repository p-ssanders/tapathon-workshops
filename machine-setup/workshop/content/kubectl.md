TAP is a kubernetes-based platform which means you'll be interacting with kubernetes at some point.

You can use Homebrew to install the Kubernetes CLI:

```
brew install kubernetes-cli
```

Or install without Homebrew: [Install and Set Up kubectl on macOS
](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/)

You might also want to alias kubectl to `k`:

```
alias k=kubectl
```

And you might want to install [zsh auto-completion](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/included/optional-kubectl-configs-zsh/) for kubectl.
